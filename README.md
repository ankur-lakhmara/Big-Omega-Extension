## What is Big Ω?
Big Ω is a browser extension which enhances your collaborative experience while you are solving coding problems online on various competitive programming websites like 

1. Leetcode
2. Hackerrank

With this tool as of now we have launched a feature that reveals information about which companies have asked the problem that you are currently solving and how many times was same problem been asked by same companies

The future feature that we will launch will give you the power of peers when you solve the problems, irrespective of any platform where you are solving the problems, the future feature will have the following options - 

1. You will be able to see all the people in the world who are solving problems on various platforms
2. Irrespective of platforms, you will be able have audio/chat conversation with online peers
3. You will be able to create groups, start coding competitions by putting timer of 30m 45m or any custom time, while tracking each others progress about who solved how many test cases, etc
4. You will also be able to sync each others screen so that you can explain logic in groups or in person with a first person view

Please let us know about our plugin at our email - manage.bigomega@gmail.com
your feedback and constructive criticism, is always appreciated, and we look forward to make this browser plugin better day by day, step by step

## Running extention locally

- Toggle developer mode on top right in order to enable it
- Click Load unpacked and choose the `build` folder in root of this project
- Your extention is loaded sucessfully, you don't even need to click it, just go to any leetcode problem and extention will start working

## How to build locally
- Clone project
- Open in any editor of your choice
- If you want to add/remove code then react code is present under `src/`, which you can edit
- Now run `npm run build` to create a loadable build/ folder
- Now to actually test changes we need to load the extention in browser so go to `chrome://extentions` through browser searchbar
- Toggle developer mode on top right in order to enable it
- Click Load unpacked and choose the `build` folder in root of this project
- Your extention is loaded sucessfully, you don't even need to click it, just go to any leetcode problem and extention will start working
